HomeStay is a full-featured, responsive booking platform built with React JS and Mongo DB, designed to seamlessly connect guests with hosts for renting rooms, apartments, or entire houses.

This web application allows users to book available properties, manage their bookings, and even become a host themselves. With robust admin controls, hosts can be approved or rejected, and all user actions are efficiently managed.

## User Access for test purpose:

### Guest access:

You can signup yourself with your email or gmail.

### Host access:
